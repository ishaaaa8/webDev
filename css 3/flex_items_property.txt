For flex-items :
we have:
->order
->flex-grow (default : 0)
 
->flex-shrink (for responsive sites)  (default :1)
->flex-basis  (% can also be use use border-box box-sizing)   
      ******  flex-basis works same as width but it is responsive as it do not trim the content in case of overflow 
        it flexibly changes its width according to content

-> flex (shorthand for above 4 )
                ->flex:3 4 2 120px;
                (flex:order grow shrink basis)
->align-self:
                flex-start flex-end flex stretch
