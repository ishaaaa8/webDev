Grid Area:

ADVANCED GRID ROW:

1) 1fr
2) repeat fn  gtc:repeat(3,1fr);
        ot gtc:1fr 1fr 1fr;
3) grid auto rows -> recall whenever you check ur fb feed rows are automatically generated

min wudth max width etc of this automatically 
generated row is defined by MINMAX() fn

grid properties:
JUSTIFY CONTENT: MAIN AXIS START END CENTER S AROUND S BTW S EVENLY
align item : cross AXIS
align content : 
place content : 
jutify-items


items:justify self 
   align self
   place items  shorthand property for justify and align
   place self 


 -> contaiiner :align-items: center;
    justify-items: center;
    

  -> items properties  justify-self: center;
    align-self: center;

    ****the above four do the samr thing the difference is that the self works for grid items unlike item-properties 
    we use self property when we want to apply on a specified element and whereas the item-properties work for all the ethe elemts present in the grid
